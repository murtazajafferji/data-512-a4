    "# Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is the most popular programming language on Earth. There are thousands of open source packages released for developers to use in their projects. When developers are deciding between similar packages that fulfill the needs of the project, they often desire to choose the most *popular* package with the largest community size, which often translates to the highest probability of future growth/support. Since *popularity* of the package is not easily measurable, users often use npm downloads or stars on Github as a proxy. However, the number of downloads is an unreliable indicator because download counts are incremented by [automated build processes/robots](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/92574016600/numeric-precision-matters-how-npm-download-counts) and GitHub stars are [indicative of the traffic or attention a package receives on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/), but not necessarily usage. Additionally, since stars and download counts are nondecreasing, users can incorrectly assume that packages with higher star and download counts currently have larger communities or are more well maintained.

    "# Goals\n",

    "Stars, commits, pull-requests, issues, and downloads are commmonly used to measure popularity of JavaScript packages on GitHub. We will attempt to show that the number references to these packages by other repositories on GitHub is a more useful metric for determining a package's *popularity*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dependency graph generated as part of this analysis can not only be used by developers to help determine which JavaScript package to choose, but it can also give insights into the dynamics of the JavaScript ecosystem, the adoption trends of JavaScript packages, and the nature of the projects consuming these packages.\n",

    "The decision to pursue this project was inspired by a common issue that people face when trying to evaluate packages on GitHub and the problem some developers have with having the importance of their work recognized. We will gather feedback from JavaScript developers during the formulation of research questions and while evaluating results of the analysis to determine if the new metric provides any additional value to them.\n"
